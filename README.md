Third year University Cloud Computing project

This project is made up of several parts to demonstrate the interconnected nature of Cloud Computing. It makes use of the following API's to allow for the creation of a stocks and shares application:

- Guardian News API to track stories related to the currently selected share
- share price API to update share prices on request
- currency converter to convert prices
- Google Firebase backend or alternatively a Marshalled/unmarshalled XML file to store data

There is also a Python or Java frontend to demonstrate how the services are technology agnostic.
